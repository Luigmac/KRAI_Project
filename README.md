# KRAI Project
### Luis Ignacio Mart√≠nez Caballero
The project corresponds to the use of the genetic algorithm for load scheduling to either minimize the electricity bill or to minimize the energy exchange with the grid.
Profiles of generation and appliances: data_app.mat
Scripts for energy minimization: EnerFlexOpt.m and loadDiff.m
Script for cost minimization: Cost_red.m and pricemin.m
Results: cost_results.mat and energy_results.mat
